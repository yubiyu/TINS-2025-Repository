[Test]
Test=All this long eve, so balmy and serene,\nhave I been gazing on the western sky,\nAnd its peculiar tint of yellow green:\nAnd still I gaze- and with how blank an eye!\nAnd those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars,\nThat give away their motion to the stars;\nThose stars, that glide behind them or between,\nNow sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen:
